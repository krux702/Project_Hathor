# BOM

The following are some of the sources for parts:

## HV Supply

MOT and HV diodes salvages from several scrapped microwave ovens.

_DANGER!_  Playing with Microwave Oven Transformers will kill you.   Seriously. 
These are very dangerous, if not operated with a high degree of safety measures and practices in place.
If you do not know what you are doing, do not attempt this project.

2kV is not a requirement for a ring launcher.  This is just my design.  A ring launcher can still be
constructed using much lower voltages, with safer power supply choices.


## Capacitor Bank:

SYN Shop got a donation of several Nichicon LNR2G392ASMEMG, 400v 3900uF capacitors.  
There are two strings in parallel.  Each string is five capacitors in searies.


## Contactor:

Designed using 1/4" acrylic, based around the following solenoid sold by Sparkfun Electronics.

Contacts are 3/8" tungston rod, source McMaster-Carr


## Control logic:

High voltage relay:

KILOVAC H-4 /S1 5 KVDC HIGH VOLTAGE SPDT RELAY.  I picked this up off eBay.

Supply relay:

Salvaged from more SYN Shop donations.  Though any 12V relay which can handle the current requirement of the MOT's primary winding will be sufficient.

Switches:

## Resistive Load

Three chassis mount wirewound resistors in series, 2kOhms @ 225W each.  Source Mouser

My first thought was to use a resistive heater element, such as from a toaster oven or space heater.  
However some back of the envelope calculations, this seemed the better option from a power handling perspective.
Plus they just look a nicer.


## Case and Mounting Hardware

Made from 1/2 clear acrylic donated to SYN Shop.  Connecting corner/edge pieces are all 3D printed.

Assembled using a collection of metric M4 and M3 hardware.  Source McMaster-Carr.  Every engineer worth his salt should have a good selection of various
screw sizes and lenghts, nuts, and washers.  They are the making of a modern erector set.

For safety, any components where high voltage could potentially be near by, such as the MOT, HV relay, and HV bridge rectifier, utilize nylon fasteners.
